        <h2>Positives:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>I like how you give people help when they might need it. Example: When you press Scenic Directions you then present the option to click on the question mark for help. (Help and documentation)
</li>
<li>I like how you give people a pop up when they click Unfavorite, Favorite, or Submitting a location that confirms the results of their actions. (Visibility of system status) 
</li>
<li>I like how you have the user select Walk, Bike, or Car when in Regular or Circular Directions. (Error prevention) 
</li>
<li>I like your green color (Aesthetic and minimalist design) </li>
<li>I like how the description of a location shows the name of the location, a picture, rating, and comments. It’s information that’s helpful to the user. (Aesthetic and minimalist design)
</li>
<li>There’s a consistent design throughout (Aesthetic and minimalist design) 
</li>
<li>The back button is always in the same place (Consistency and standards)
</li>

       

        </ol>
        <h2>Areas for improvement:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>[Minor] I would make your Take a Trip button look more like a button. Maybe make it smaller, make the text bigger, use a different background color, etc. (Consistency and standards) 
</li>
<li>[Major] Add the ability to zoom in and move around on the maps (consistency and standards)
</li>
<li>[Major] Space out the List View of the directions more to make it easier to use. (Aesthetic and minimalist design) 
</li>
<li>[Cosmetic] Center the headers relative to the entire screen, not just the area without the back button. (Aesthetic and minimalist design) 
</li>
<li>[Minor] Change the Back button on the directions to better tell the user that pressing that button will allow them to edit their route. (Error prevention)
</li>
<li>[Major] For circular directions, change the wording of ‘Start’ to be ‘Start and end’ or something else that again showcases the fact that these are circular directions (Consistency and standards)
</li>
<li>[Major] It’s not apparent that the list of scenery under Discover the Scenery is clickable. Also not apparent that the list under Favorites is clickable (Consistency and standards)
</li>
<li>[Catastrophic] There’s no home button. (Consistency and standards, user control and freedom)
</li>
<li> [Major] Under Discover the Scenery, it’s not apparent what happens once you press GO. (Visibility of system status)
</li>
<li>[Cosmetic] The list under favorites is not visually appealing. It seems a bit cluttered. Maybe space things out a bit more or add bullet points or something. (Aesthetic and minimalist design.)
</li>
<li>[Catastrophic] I think there should be a way to choose the distance of the route or time the route will take to complete. Without that, people who don’t have that much time might go off on a route they don’t have time to complete or just may not use the app for fear of that happening. (Error prevention, user control and freedom) 
</li>
<li>[Minor] I think there should be a way to categorize Favorite scenic places by location. For example, I could have favorite places in NYC and LA, but it might not be helpful to have them all grouped together since those places are not near each other (Flexibility and efficiency of use) 
</li>
<li>[Minor] There should be a way to Submit a Location based on your current location. A user could find a scenic place but not know the exact address of where they are. Instead of having them guess at a location, it’d be better to just take advanatge of the GPS (Error prevention)
</li>
<li>[Minor] There should be an option to take a photo under Submit a Location as well as Upload a Photo. Generally (on phones) there’s an option to Take a Photo or Choose a Photo. (Consistency and standards).
</li>
