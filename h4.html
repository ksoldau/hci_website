        <h2>Prototyping -- VirtualAgenda</h2>
        <h2>About VirtualAgenda</h2>
      <p>VirtualAgenda would be a website. An agenda book is an extremely useful tool to carry around and helps to keep students (and others) organized and on top of due dates. However, when people forget to bring their agenda books places it prohibits them from writing crucial assignment information down. VirtualAgenda aims to solve that problem by saving everything in an online account. This way, people can access their assignment and due date information from anywhere with an internet connection and don’t have to worry about lugging around their agenda book to class or meetings. Another annoying problem this helps to solve is that people have a hard time remembering what they’ve already completed vs. what needs to be completed. In VirtualAgenda when an assignment has been completed it will be checked off and the background will be grayed out. When an assignment has not completed it will be unchecked and the background will not be filled in with gray. </p><p>

In my system, users add assignments into the calendar. The assignments are located and filed under the day that they are due on. This way, users will always know when work must be completed by. Users will have the option to view their virtual agenda by day, week, month, year, or in a list. When users first log in the screen will be set to week view so they can get a quick glance of what assignments have due dates that are coming up. When viewing it by day they can see what’s due on the current day and what’s due the day after. When viewing it in week mode they can see what assignments are due for a certain week. Month view allows them to see what assignments are due in a given month, and year view lets them see how much they’ve completed and have left to do for a given year. List view just lets them see this information, but in the more compact form of a list. In order to allow users to not get lost in terms of dates, the current date is specified by a certain look (in the wireframe’s case, it’s a light blue color that shows this).</p><p>

Users can add assignments into their profile under any of the views. The wireframe does not support the following functionality, but when users add assignments in the actual system it will stay consistent throughout the views. Also, when a user specifies they’ve completed an assignment by checking off the box that will also update across their entire profile. Any edits made to assignments or areas will also update across the profile. In fact, any changes users make will stay consistent throughout their account no matter what view they are using.</p>
<h2> Personas </h2>
<p>1. Jill is 20 and a sophomore Mechanical Engineering major at Northeastern University. She values good grades and likes to keep organized. She’s the Director of Design and Social Media for a entrepreneurship club on campus and frequently has to create fliers by certain dates. When she’s not doing school work or work for her club she likes to walk around Boston with friends and see sights she’s never seen before. However, before she goes out and about on the town she likes to make sure she’s done all of her homework that’s due in the near future. </p>
<p>
2. Dan is a junior in high school. He is an IB diploma student and volunteers a lot at the local animal shelter to get his CAS (Creativity, Action, and Service) hours. He normally does his homework right before the day it’s due because he has barely any free time and has trouble staying organized. When he’s in class he thinks he’ll remember what homework is due for each, but he has so much going on that he forgets.</p><p>

3. Ben is a freelance graphic designer who has work due every couple days. He finds it hard to keep track of what he needs to do and what he’s already done. He makes his living off of this work so it’s imperative that he stays on top of things and can keep track of his assignments. 
</p><p>
4. Anna is a math teacher who has to plan assignments, make quizzes, and grade every week. In order to stay on top of her work and make sure her kids are supported she needs to have her materials prepared before every class. When her students take tests she also likes to make sure it doesn’t take her too long to get the tests back to them. However, she also enjoys spending time with her two small children and so she needs to stay organized. 
</p>

<h2> Task Scenarios </h2>
<p>
1. Jill’s friends have invited her to a friend’s birthday extravaganza. She really wants to go hang out with her friends because she hasn’t been able to in a while. Her school work has kept her from a lot of these group gatherings recently. However, she won’t feel comfortable going unless she’s on top of her school work. She really wants to go but first wants to check to see if she’s done all of her homework that will be due on Monday or Tuesday. </p><p>

2. It’s nearing the end of Dan’s fall semester and a lot of IB diploma assignments are due. If he turns in any assignment late he probably won’t get his IB diploma, so these are important. Dan realizes he’ll really need to make sure he’s completed all of his internal assessments by their specified due dates so he needs to be able to see clearly when all of his IB assignments are due.  </p><p>

It’s a busy time of year and Ben needs to make sure he spaces out when his work must be due and when he’s completed what he needs to. If he doesn’t do this he’ll lose cliental, money, and it will hurt his reputation as a designer. A new client wants a logo made, so Ben looks at his calendar to see when he might have time to finish it while still working on all the other projects.</p><p>

4. Anna wants to accompany her two small children on a weekend girl scout trip. However, she has to make sure she’s prepared her lessons and worksheets for the upcoming week. Since report cards are almost due she also needs to grade the exams that her students have recently taken. In order to go on the girl scout trip she has to make sure she’s completed all of this. </p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>
- A user wants to know if all of their homework is done for the following few days so they check to make sure.
</p><p>
- A user looks at what they have due for a certain subject/area. </p><p>
- A user adds an assignment to their calendar/schedule/plan. </p><p>
- A user deletes or edits an assignment that they’ve already inputted. </p><p>
- A user looks at how much work they have due in the coming months. </p><p>
- A user enrolled in a new class so they need to add another subject area.
</p>

<h2>The Wireframes </h2>
<p> I created the wireframes using a program called Axure. To see them, <a href="axure/start.html"> click here</a>. If that link looks messed up, try <a href="axure/index.html">this.</a></p>
