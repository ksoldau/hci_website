        <h2>Ethnography   -   afterHOURS in Curry</h2>
        <div class="ethno_fix">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
	I sat in afterHOURS in the Curry Student Center for an hour on Saturday. AfterHOURS is a small entertainment venue on campus, but is mostly used as a Starbucks cafe. There's a Starbucks in the room, along with tables and chairs to sit at. The atmosphere is something I find relaxing so I wanted to go there to see if there were any problems that I hadn’t spotted before. I got to afterHOURS at 2:30 on a Saturday and there were 36 people sitting around, most drinking Starbucks coffee. Fifteen people were in line. When the girl sitting next to me asked if I could watch her computer while she went up to order I figured out what I wanted my focus to be. There is no way for people (who are using their computers) to order without either leaving their computer at a table, or taking it with them when they stand in line. Thus, I chose to focus on the task of going up to order from Starbucks after you’ve already settled in at a table or other seat. </p>

<h2>Process and Findings </h2>
	<p>People did their homework, chatted with friends, and ordered from Starbucks while I was there. However, I only focused on people who were sitting at the tables, not those who only came in, ordered, then left. People who engaged in the task of getting up from their table to order from Starbucks were all college students, both male and female. While I was at the location there was a male to female ratio of 1:2. Out of the thirty students who were there, twenty-two were there alone. Twenty-one people had laptops and only two of those people had a laptop that was not a MacBook. Most, if not all, of the people there seemed to be doing homework. The only object everyone used while performing this task was some sort of artifact that let them pay for what they ordered (credit card, cash, Husky Card). One person also used a backpack when performing the task because he packed up his belongings before waiting in line to order, only to sit down at a table again once he had gotten his beverage.
	I interviewed two students while I was there. The first person I interviewed was a third year Biology major. She said she frequented afterHOURS two or three times a week to work on lab reports and other assignments and that she had been doing that regularly since her second year. She said she had no problem leaving her MacBook computer or iPhone out to go up to order because in all of the years she’d been going there she had never once seen or heard of a theft. “I know what the people who come here are like,” she said, “so I’m not too worried.” However, she did say that when the lines were long she’d wait to go up to order because she wasn’t sure how much to trust those who were just running in and out of the store. </p><p>
	The second person I interviewed was someone who took their laptop up with her when she went to order. She was a second year Music Industry major who only came to afterHOURS once or twice a month. She felt like leaving her stuff out was an unnecessary risk to take when the line was long. She said she might just leave her laptop out if the line was short because she could run up and order and be back before anything could really happen. In order to make sure her spot wouldn’t be gone when she got back she left her jacket on the chair. I asked her why she wasn’t worried about her jacket or other belongings getting stolen and she said it was because the jacket wasn’t nearly as valuable. </p>
<p>	The interviews gave me insight into the types of people who use the space and how they complete the task of ordering (while in the middle of work). There are generally two groups of people in afterHOURS: those who are doing work and sitting at tables and those who just go in to order and then leave. For those who sit at tables it seems that they get more worried about leaving their valuables (ex: MacBook) out as the line gets longer. Although there are  peole who will never feel comfortable leaving a laptop out in the open, it seems that a majority of the others  are happier and less stressed when the line is shorter. When the line at Starbucks is long they are hesitant to go up because it means the wait to get back to their seat would be longer and there are a greater number of possible people who could take it. I also learned that for those who visit afterHOURS frequently, the idea of leaving a computer out isn’t so scary because they’ve seen the type of people who go through there and know that it wouldn’t be that easy to take the computer. For people who don’t visit the place as much it is a more worrisome idea because they don’t know what to expect from the general population who utilizes the space. </p>
<p>	I saw three different ways that people went about performing this task out of the eleven total people I saw doing it. All started out by working on something at their table or seat, then people differed in how they acted. If people did not have a computer out they did not seem worried about leaving their stuff; I saw three people without laptops out just get up and order without taking any of their belongings with them. Some people who had laptops, like the first person I interviewed, simply left their computer out and went to order stuff without a second glance. I saw four people do this in the hour I was there. Other people would ask a stranger or friend who was sitting near them to watch their computer and other belongings. This happened to me and I also saw one other person do this. The last group of people brought their computer up with them when they ordered. I saw two people do this. </p>
	<p>Depending on the length of the line it took people zero to three minutes to get through the line; no one went up when the line was long, only when it was relatively short. The longest line that someone from the general seating area left their stuff to join was seven people deep. For comparison, at 3:10 (40 minutes after I’d arrived) there were 19 people in line. Not one person got up to order when the line was any more than 7 people long. After people ordered they had to wait about three minutes to collect their drink of choice, then they sat back down. After drinks and food were collected the two people who had asked a stranger to watch their computer said a quick thank you then got right back to work. Those who just left their computer without asking anyone to watch it went back to their spot and began work again as well. The two people who brought their computers up with them didn’t place them down until they were back at their seat. </p>

<h2>Conclusions </h2>
	<p>Overall, it seemed as though there were a couple reasons for why people went about this task in the way they did. Their familiarity with afterHOURS and the length of the line at the Starbucks seemed to play a role. I think this problem could be tackled in a variety of ways, but that the best and easiest way to go about fixing the problem would be to make sure the line in Starbucks doesn’t get too long. When the line was short or non existent people were more likely to leave their table to order, but when the line was too long it seemed as though people didn’t want to risk being away from the table for an extended period of time. Shortening the line would solve this problem. Perhaps giving people the ability to order from a wall-mounted interface, their smart phone, or simply being able to view the menu on a screen so they could figure out what they wanted to order before being in front of a cashier would reduce the wait time. It’s also possible that an appliance that the Starbuck’s employees use isn’t efficient enough and the interface of that could be improved upon. No one wants to have to worry about their expensive laptop or other belongings getting stolen, so lessening even the slightest bit of worry would make the atmosphere in afterHOURS even more relaxed and homework friendly than it already is.
