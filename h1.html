        <h2>Idea #1 - Virtual Agenda</h2>
        <p>
I always lose track of my agenda or forget to bring it somewhere when I need it, so I want to make a virtual one. This could take the form of a site you log-in to or an application (it could look the same either way, not sure what would make the most sense yet though). You would be able to view the agenda by day, week, or month. To use it, you would input your homework/assignments into the days when they are due and then have the ability to virtually cross them off once they’re completed. You would also be able to view assignments in a list-format based sorted by due date. This would allow you to better plan when to complete what homework and help ensure you wouldn’t miss any assignments because of poor organization or a misplacement of your agenda. 
        </p>

        <h2>Idea #2 - Ukulele Website</h2>
        <p>I’ve recently been playing some ukulele, but have noticed that most websites centered around the instrument don’t have the best functionality so I want to make one that does. My website would have lyrics (with chords), chord charts, and tabs. It would have the ability to search the site by artist, album, song, and difficulty. Something that’s annoying about most websites I’ve seen is that they do not adequately distinguish between chords and tabs, so this site would be sure to do that. You’d be able to browse through various lists to find a song you want to learn, or use the search option to find it. The lists would be like top hits, best songs of the 90s, television show theme songs, easiest to learn, etc. Once you’ve found a song, you’ll be able to make the page automatically scroll and there’ll be chord charts of the needed chords stationed on the side of the lyrics. The scrolling will allow you to play without having to stop to scroll farther down the lyrics/chords/tabs. The needed chord charts will allow you to look at how to play the chords at any point in the song without having to grab a book, scroll up, or navigate to a separate page. </p>

        <h2>Idea #3 - Shopping list app</h2>
        <p>This grocery store mobile app would assist with your shopping experience. It would allow you to keep various shopping lists, make new lists, and store recipes. You’ll be able to construct a shopping list by choosing from past lists, making a new list, combining multiple recipes into a list, or a combination of these. Once in the store you’ll be able to check items off the list as you go. You can either use the scanner function of the app or input the price of the item to keep a running tally of how much your groceries are going to cost. Being a poor college student, it’s important for me to keep track of how much money I’m spending, but it’s virtually impossible to do so when I’m making a big shopping trip. This would help change that.
