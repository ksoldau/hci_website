        <h2>The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 5</h2>
 <p>Chapter 5 of Donald A. Norman’s The Design of Everyday Things is all about errors. People constantly make errors, both slips and mistakes. Slips happen when a user’s subconscious actions interrupt the intended goal and are often the result of not paying enough attention. Mistakes are the results of conscious choices and are actions taken to get to a (wrong) goal (Norman 106). </p>
<p>
There are different types of slips: capture errors, description errors, data-driven errors, associative activation errors, loss-of-activation errors, and mode errors (Norman 107). 
Capture errors often occur when two action sequences have common initial actions. Description errors happen when internal descriptions of intentions aren’t precise enough and often happen when objects look alike. Data-driven errors are triggered by external sensory data. Associative activation errors are prompted by internal thoughts and associations. Loss-of-activation errors happen when the intended goal is forgotten. Lastly, mode errors arise when devices have different modes of operation. 
</p><p>
Detecting slips is possible through analyzing feedback, but if there’s no feedback the result of the action isn’t visible. Even when it’s clear there’s been a slip, it can be difficult to concentrate on the correct level of action to detect it (Norman 111). The study of slips has resulted in two design lessons: one for preventing slips before they occur and one for detecting and correcting them when they do occur (Norman 113). Mistakes are hard to discover as well, especially when they involve misinterpreting the situation. Design is often the reason people are led astray (Norman 128). To remedy this designers should: 
<ul class="list_in_reading">
<li>Understand what causes error and minimize the causes. </li>
<li>Make it possible to undo actions and difficult to perform irreversible actions. </li>
<li>Make it easy to figure out and correct errors that do happen.</li>
<li>Don’t think of errors as errors, think of them as approximated actions for what’s desired.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Mistakes arise when inappropriate goals are chosen. Many poor decisions are made at the unpredictable whims of human thought. Subconscious thought is rapid and automatically finds the best possible match of past experiences to the current one. Conscious thought is slow, labored ,and limited by the capacity of short term memory (Norman 127). Mistakes can be made when the current situation is mismatched with something in the past because our memories are biased towards the typical event or the discrepant event.
</p><p>
Everyday activities should be simple because tasks should be structured either shallowly or narrowly. Shallow structures involve multiple simple alternative options. Narrow structures are when a couple of alternatives only lead to a couple more alternatives; any action to be completed is determined by it’s place in the sequence. Activities that are not everyday, such as recreational activities, consist of wide and deep structures (Norman 124). </p><p>

When mistakes occur the information given to a user was probably misleading. When slips happen the cause is probably poor design or distraction. Systems should be designed to be able to withstand errors. Errors should be easy to discover and to correct (Norman 131). Forcing functions are one way of doing this; they make it so failure at one step prevents the next step from being completed. However, forcing functions are normally a nuisance in everyday life. </p>
<p>
Errors shouldn’t be thought of as the opposite of correct behavior, but instead of the entire cooperative interaction between a person and machine. Required knowledge should be put in the world so people don’t have to remember as much, but efficient operation must be allowed when the user has learned and has knowledge in the head. Natural and artificial constraints, forcing functions, and natural mappings should be exploited and used. Options should be readily available when executing and the results of actions must be apparent when evaluating. It's also important that users can determine state of a system.
</p>

<p>

In class I would like to talk more about how to make sure that tasks are simple enough. I want to learn more about how to ensure they will be shallow or narrow and not wide/deep. Although it seems obvious now I had never really thought much about how psychology can give designers insight into how best to design a product, so I would like to learn more about how to utilize such information. I found the sections about the workings of human thought to be interesting. I especially liked the part about highways and how they are are purposefully designed with information fed slowly and sequentially. I’d never thought much about how the workings of the mind could greatly aid in design and so I found this whole section fascinating and felt that I learned a lot. Though, looking back now, I can’t believe I hadn’t thought more about it before.</p> 
<h2>The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 6</h2>
<p> In Chapter 6 of The Design of Everyday Things, Norman further explains how to create a successful design. He says natural design and it’s continuous cycle of testing, discovering errors, modifying, and retesting would be ideal, but it just doesn’t meet the demands of time nor the designer’s want to be unique. This design strategy isn’t perfect because once a product is satisfactory and successful it can be counterproductive to change it. For example, typewriter keyboards came about through evolutionary design as people tried to figure out how to solve mechanical errors. Although those same errors won’t occur with today’s keyboards, the design still works well enough that it wouldn’t make sense to make millions or billions of people relearn how to type (Norman 149).</p><p>

Norman said not to put aesthetics first because that leads designers to go astray. Many museums and design centers put aesthetic first and forget to think about how it is to be used (Norman 155). It’s important to study end users of a design and to not just rely on what the designers, engineers, programmers, or managers think. Clients are not the end users and are often more concerned with price than usability. Unfortunately, corporate bureaucracy often separates designers from the end users. </p><p>

Perhaps the design process is flawed. There are an astounding number of possible solutions to a gigantic number of problems. The fact that there’s no such thing as an average person complicates the process even further. Any design should be usable by a vast array of people. It should also be able to withstand problems of focus, so it must be designed for the problem case. Forcing functions and cultural constraints can be of great help (Norman 165). 
</p><p>
It’s also important that designers should stray from creeping featurism and the worshipping of false images, even when under great time and economic pressures. When too many features are added the program can become too complex, too unusable. If a multitude of features must be had, modularization can organize them to make sure tasks can still easily be completed (Photoshop is a good example of this). Just because an item looks fancy doesn’t mean it’ll be easily usable (Norman 174).
</p><p>
Designers of computer systems generally do things wrong. They make things invisible, create arbitrary mappings, are inconsistent, don’t treat errors correctly, and make it easy to perform dangerous operations. To create better designs they must take users’ needs into account. Good computer systems should be explorable, states of systems should be visible, effects of actions should be obvious, and undesirable results from actions should be reversible (Norman 184).</p>
<p>
In class I’d like to discuss how important it is to design for everyone. I want to know how usable you should make your product for every type of person. For example, if your target audience was twenty-year-old college kids, is it acceptable to say that it’s not necessary to design the product so that a sixty-year-old with arthritis could use it? Flexibility can clearly help and make it so as many people as possible can use your product, but at what point do you draw the line? Could not making your product extremely substantially stunt your growth? 
</p><p>
I thought the part about the old telephone was exceptionally interesting since it really made me think about the design of everyday things. The old telephone was designed so it could fall of the table without hanging up the call. The design seems ingenious to me and clearly worked for the time. This made me think about all sorts of other products and realize how bad a lot of designs are at making sure that something adverse doesn’t happen if a mistake is made. For example, I think my dishwasher at home is poorly designed because it’s extremely easy to brush up against it and stop the cycle
</p>
<h2>The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 7</h2>
<p>
In Chapter 7 of The Design of Everyday Things, Norman summarizes the book and his ideas on user-centered design. He says the user’s needs and interests should be at the focus of creating usable and understandable everyday things. In essence, it’s important to make sure the user can figure out how to use the interface, and make sure they know what’s going on. Designers should exploit natural properties of people and the world around them to avoid need of labels or instructions. They should also design for error. When all else fails, he says they should resort to standardization (Norman 189). </p><p>

Knowledge in the real world and in the head should be taken into account when designing. Good conceptual models are also key; they make devices easier to learn. Principles of operation should be visible, actions should be consistent with conceptual model, and visible parts should showcase current state of device. There are three types of mental models: design model, the user’s model, and the system image. The design and user’s model should be the same, while the system image should be consistent with them. 
</p><p>
To create simpler tasks four major technological approaches can be followed. One, provide mental aids but don’t change the task. Two, use technology to make things visible and provide feedback but don’t take away ability to control. Three, automate but don’t change the task. Four, change general nature of the task (Norman 192). Making things visible let’s people know what actions can be done, how to perform them, and what the results of them are. Designers should also ensure to exploit natural mappings and constraints; these guide the user to the correct action and make it unlikely they’ll take any other route. When users do stray from the correct path, they need to be able to recover. Designing for errors is a necessity. When all else seems to fail, resort to standardization so users will know how to use the device. Standards can be hard to agree upon, but once set they contribute to a significant ease of use (Norman 202).
</p><p>
However, some things should be difficult to use (security systems, for example). It’s still important to know and use design principles in this instance because you have to know the rules before you can violate them. On the flip side, it’s also hard to make things easy to use. Just because something looks easy doesn’t mean that it is. Complexity of appearance has a directly proportionate relationship to the number of controls while ease of use is inversely proportional to the number. Hiding controls that are not being used is a great way to make something look easy and still have good controls (Norman 210).
</p><p>
Tools and design affect our society in great ways. Just take a look at how the different mediums in which we communicate has changed our lives (pen, typewriter, hypertext). Since design does affect everyone’s everyday lives Norman believes designers have a lot of responsibility and should take all of the principles he discussed in this book into account in order to make devices usable. If an object is merely pretty he doesn’t see it as serving any real purpose. If designers are the ones to make the products they need to accept responsibility and try to inject more good design into the world instead of bad.

I would like to talk more about constraints in class. Both physical and cultural constraints, as well as any others that may exist. I know the book talked about these before as well but I think it would be interesting to learn how to exploit constraints to our advantage. It would be helpful to know what kinds of cultural constraints are already at our disposal. I found this book to be extremely interesting and engaging, especially with its use of examples, and thought it was cool that some of his predictions for the “future” actually exist today. He seemed to fantasize about a day when we’d have whole libraries at our fingertips. In 2013, we have all that and more. One thing I didn’t understand or agree with about this chapter is Norman’s idea that spatial relationships between controls and system/objects they operate should be a direct movement of the controls that’s similar to the expected operation of the system. I don’t think this should always  be the case, especially when people don’t know exactly how the backend of a system is working. I could be misunderstanding, but if someone isn’t knowledgeable about the inner workings of a computer, for example, then a control that mimics that will do them no good. Still, overall, I enjoyed this book as a whole and feel as though it taught me valuable information about design.</p>
