        <h2>Positives:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>You did a good job of allowing users to leave an unwanted state. There was always a way to cancel. (User control and freedom) </li>
        <li>You did a good job of keeping words on buttons consistent. For example, ‘cancel’ always meant the same thing and you never used a word other than ‘cancel’ for the same action. (Consistency and standards)</li>
        <li>You did a good job with keeping your dialogues short and sweet. (Aesthetic and minimalist design)</li>
        <li>Your “Take a Photo” function is easy to use because it resembles the camera app on the iPhone that users will already be familiar with. (Consistency and standards) 
</li>
<li>The terms you used are ones users will be familiar with and know the meaning of. Ex: closet, filter, tags (Match between system and the real world)
</li>
<li>I like the delete button as a trash can. It’s small and doesn’t take up much room, but gets the point across. (Aesthetic and minimalist design)
</li>
<li>I like the button that adds a photo because it’s small and doesn’t take up much room, but I knew what it was going to do before I pressed it. (Aesthetic and minimalist design). 
</li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Areas for improvement:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>[Minor] When you go to delete an outfit it seems as though it might be too easy to make a mistake. Right now you have it so that you just hit the trash can and then hit delete. I think having some words (like, “You are about to delete this outfit”) accompanying the delete button so users are reminded about what they’re about to do would be beneficial. (Error prevention) </li>
        <li>[Cosmetic] You seem to have a lot of unused space in your design. This makes it so the picture and tags are a bit small. I would recommend utilizing more of the screen space. (Aesthetic and minimalist design)
</li>
<li>[Major] There doesn’t seem to be a way to add a tag in the Filter section. (User control and freedom)
</li>
<li>[Cosmetic] In the Closet, the tags look like buttons. This made me want to click on them. Either add functionality for them to be buttons for something, or make them look less like buttons. (Aesthetic and minimalist design)
</li>
<li>[Cosmetic] When you click on the option to add an outfit, the white text for “Take Photo” and “Choose Photo” is a little hard to read on the gray gradient. (Aesthetic and minimalist design). 
</li>
<li>[Major] When in the Closet it doesn’t seem like there’s a way to see which Filters are in place. This could cause a problem if people think they have no tags/filters on, but are confused about why only some of their outfits are showing up. (Error prevention)
</li>
<li>[Major] It’s not clear how a user could look through all of their outfits at once (with no filters in place). (Error prevention) 
</li>
<li>[Catastrophic] I can’t tell what’s supposed to happen when I search in the Filter. Does it do anything? (Error prevention)
</li>
<li>[Cosmetic] The cancel button in your “Take a Photo” function is blue, but in the rest of the app it is gray. This could also pose a problem because it’s the same color as the “Retake” and “Use” buttons seen after you take a photo. (Consistency and standards/Error prevention)
</li>
<li>
 [Major] Some of your buttons seem a little too small. Ex: your Retake and Use button after you take a photo. (Aesthetic and minimalist design)
</li>
<li> [Major] When taking a photo, the Cancel button is in the same exact spot in which the Retake button was. Since it’s also the same color as the Retake button, users might click that and go out of the Take Photo section on accident. (Error prevention)
</li>
<li> [Major] When taking a photo, clicking anywhere on the screen makes it take a Photo. A photo should only be taken when the user hits the circular camera button. (Error prevention)
</li>
<li> [Major] When adding tags to a photo, there’s no way to add a new tag. You can type in the box that says “New tag” but there’s no button to actually add it. (Error prevention) 
</li>
<li> [Catastrophic] There doesn’t seem to be a way to edit the tags on a photo once you’ve already set it the first time. (User control and freedom)
</li>
