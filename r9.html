The first reading, <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/think-outside-the-box-but-dont-forget-the-box-exists" class="citation">Think Outside the Box but Don’t Forget the Box Exists</a>, discusses consistency on the web. Inconsistencies can cause delayed responses, yet creativity shouldn’t be avoided. A good example of this is bathroom signs since designers take some artistic freedom in designing these signs, yet they still convey the correct message. The article says there are two ways to follow standards: macro-level consistency and micro-level consistency. The macro-approach follows well established market standards and the micro-approach follows consistency within a specific website. Consistency can be achieved through color, shape, and/or type consistency. In regards to type consistency, when there are too many variations in font it is hard for users to scan a page and get the information they seek. Following the boundaries of convention will keep designers on target, but creativity shouldn’t be avoided. What matters most is that a seamless user experience is created. </p>

The second article, <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/01/09/user-experience-design/" class="citation">10 Most Common Misconceptions About User Experience Design</a>
, is all about setting the record straight about what UX Designers actually do. UX design is not the following ten things: 
<ol><li>User interface design. The interface is just one component of user experience. UX design is more about decoration or styling. </li>
<li>A Step in the Process. UX Design can’t just be one step in the process, but should be continuously integrated into the entire process. </li>
<li>About technology. Instead, technology is used by designers to accomplish greater goals. Also, UX design is not limited to just products with screens. </li>
<li>Just about usability. It’s also about learnability, desirability, accessibility, credibility, and more.</li>
<li>Just about the user. The needs and goals of the business must also be met. </li>
<li>Expensive. Designers can pick and choose which methods to use that make the most sense for individual projects.</li>
<li>Easy. There isn’t one secret method to solve all the problems and people who are trained to do the job of UX designer normally perform better than programmers or designers who are not. </li>
<li>The role of one person or department. The entire team working on a project should be concerned with it.</li>
<li>A single discipline. It involves information architects, user experience architects, interaction designer, usability engineer, design analysts, and more. </li>
<li> A choice. To ensure that a good end product is achieved, UX design can’t just be an afterthought.

The third article, <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/five-low-hanging-ux-tips" class="citation">Five Low-Hanging UX Tips</a>, talks about five ways to improve the experience of an app. First, it says that when in doubt, make the app faster since page load time affects user abandonment. Second, it stated removing stuff is important because it removes barriers for people who want to accomplish tasks. Third, it noted that a good application should make common-sense assumptions for the user about things they may not care about or want to deal with right away. Fourth, it said customers should be delighted, not just content. Fifth, and finally, the article mentioned that the first impressions of an app matter greatly, so it’s important to make that count.</p><p>

The fourth article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/closeness-of-actions-and-objects-gui/" class="citation">Closeness of Actions and Objects in GUI design</a>, discusses how users react to the placements of buttons. Objects that are close together on the screen, the same color or shape, that move or change together, or that reside within an enclosure are seen as related by the users. This is the closeness gestalt principle. When buttons, drop-downs, or other GUI elements are too far away from the objects they affect users normally assume the features are missing. The article talks about how iTunes has both good and bad examples of these practices.

I would like to discuss more about fonts in class. I know we talked about this a tiny bit already, but I’d like to go more in depth. I’ve never really learned anything about fonts in any of my classes, but they seem like an extremely important part of design in many aspects. I wonder what fonts are normally good for what, when to bold things, etc. I found the fourth article pretty interesting because I’d only briefly thought about buttons in that much depth before. I guess some of the stuff was information I considered common sense, but it was interesting to see those ideas stated outright. I felt as though the article was insightful. In general, I thought all of these readings were useful, informative, and easy to get through. </p>
