The first article, <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/change-on-a-dime-agile-design" class="citation">Change on a Dime: Agile Design</a> by John Anderson, gives an overview of agile development and offers some tips. Agile development is a movement away from a comprehensive initial design and towards the concept of focussing on smaller deliverables. Agile development takes place through defined iteration cycles of 1-2 weeks. Agile development is great because it allows development to adapt to customer needs, budgets, innovations in the field, and potential ventures into uncharted territories. However, this also means that the client can change requirements at anytime and independently developed features may feel disjointed. For designers to work in this environment it’s best if they design as much as they can upfront, before the first stage of development beings. Designers need to be aware of and okay with the fact that they might have to walk away from days worth of work if specifications change. They should also keep designs simple and maintain consistency through development. As the agile development process moves along it’s important for designers and developers to continue ensuring that their end users and clients will be happy. </p><p>

The second article, <a href="http://www.chi2005.org/cfp/guide.html" class="citation">Guide to Successful Submissions: Papers</a>, provides helpful tips on CHI submissions. Only about 20% of submitted papers are chosen to present their work, so if you want to have the best chance of getting accepted you have to take special care. The article gives an overview of the form used by reviewers in order to help show what you should include in your paper. The form asks about the paper’s contribution to the field of HCI, a review of the paper in terms of the criteria laid out in Call for Papers, and other aspects. Reviewers will look into the significance of your contributions, what others can benefit from it, the validity of the work, and the originality of the work. It’s better for a paper to present one strong contribution than a couple weaker ones. In order to benefit your readers the most it’s best to keep in mind the kinds of people you think might benefit from reading it. Most commonly, validity is demonstrated by showing that you used sufficiently sound methods to arrive at your contribution or that you conducted an evaluation of your contribution that provides sufficient confirmation of your claims about it. You should explain what you did and why you did it. Credit for originality is also given if it goes beyond work that’s already been reported in other journals. The work should be described clearly and concisely. </p><p>

In class I’d like to discuss more about what the second reading said because I’m still a little iffy on what the final paper is all about. Specifically, I’d like to dive a little more into something like this example that was talked about, “For example, if you have developed a new type of menu, capable of reducing errors in selecting menu items, you will probably run a careful experiment to measure error rates with this and other types of menu.” I think this example is a lot like what my group (PrereqMe) will be doing for our paper, so I’d like to know how best to go about doing so. I’d like to know more about how to adequately demonstrate the effectiveness of our product/design over another. I found the first reading interesting because it delved into a development process I’m not extremely familiar with, but I wish it talked more about how designers deal with it. I know it went into a little bit of detail, but I’d like to know more about it. This wasn’t particularly annoying, but I think I would have been even more interested if it talked about how designers dealt with organizing layout and such If requirements and specifications are always changing.</p>
