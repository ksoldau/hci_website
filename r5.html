        <h2>Leap Motion</h2>
        <p> The Leap Motion is a gesture-controlled platform that peripherally tracks human body movements. These gestures are then translated onto a video display. The system can follow as many items that can be placed into the 3D space it tracks (<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/why-the-leap-is-the-best-gesture-control-system-weve-ever-tested/" class="citation">Baldwin</a>). Hand gestures, individual finger gestures, the angles of fingers relative to the display, and tools are all registered by the Leap. If you’re holding a pencil, for example, the system can tell the difference between that pencil and your fingers. Users don’t have to learn what gestures do what to perform a desired action. Instead, the system provides constant dynamic feedback (<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/26/3118592/leap-motion-gesture-controls" class="citation">Pierce</a>).  This allows for a greater ease of use and makes it so a tutorial or instruction manual on the device isn’t needed.</p>
        <p> Leap Motion co-founders Michael Buckwald and David Holz say their device is 200 times more precise than Kinect. This means that, unlike the Kinect, fine and less demanding gestures instead of big and sweeping ones can be used to control an interface. A small area can be mapped onto a larger one, so no problem is posed by a small workspace and a large screen.  The lag time between when you make a movement and when that gesture is registered by the device is imperceptible (<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/why-the-leap-is-the-best-gesture-control-system-weve-ever-tested/" class="citation">Baldwin</a>). The Leap can already be used as a trackpad and could be compatible with many, if not all, touch screen interfaces. </p>
        <p> I’m really excited and interested to know what developers are going to be able to use the Leap to create. In class I’d like to talk about if there’s any history for having multiple (similar) controls for a system. For example, it seems like the Leap might make it possible to easily switch between documents you’re working on with just a swish of the fingers. Would that mean some of the trackpad is obsolete? Or would you also be able to perform the same action on the trackpad? I’m curious to know if this might someday replace functionality of the trackpad or simply augment it. </p>
        <p> I found these readings extremely interesting, especially since the $70 price tag means it’s a product I could potentially get my hands on. The 3D drawing shown in one of the videos was really remarkable and it would be awesome if, say, animators could someday create a character or scenery by virtually drawing and shaping it in the air. I’m curious to know whether this technology could potentially be something that is built into a laptop, desktop computer, television, or other device. I’m cautious to get my hopes up about the product simply because history’s shown us that new technologies don’t always turn out as great as we expect. However, both articles had extremely positive things to say about it. I really hope it doesn’t disappoint because I want to be able to see what creative and innovative ideas people come up with that could take advantage of the speed and preciseness of the Leap.</p>
